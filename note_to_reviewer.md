## Design Strategy

### Current Approach:

#### Data Structures:
- **results**: A dictionary with status code groups (e.g., "2XX", "4XX") as keys and deques of response times as values.
- **errors**: A dictionary with exception types as keys and deques of error messages as values.

#### Synchronization:
- **Locks**: Two asyncio locks (results_lock and errors_lock) are used to synchronize access to the results and errors dictionaries. This ensures thread safety and prevents race conditions during concurrent access by multiple tasks.

### Metrics Calculation:
- **Deque Efficiency**: The deques provide efficient appending and popping operations, which is crucial for handling high-frequency updates typical in load testing scenarios. They also offer memory efficiency, allowing for effective management of large volumes of response times and error messages.
- **Size Restriction**: Using deques allows for optional size restriction, enabling control over memory usage and ensuring only the most relevant data is retained.

### Alternative Approach:
- **Counters and Aggregators**: Another approach could use counters for total requests, and categorized response statuses (2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX). Additionally, aggregators could be used for summing response times.
  - **Efficiency**: This approach would reduce memory overhead, as it avoids storing individual response times and errors, focusing instead on aggregated metrics.
  - **Metrics Calculation**: Aggregated counters and sum of times would allow straightforward calculation of metrics like average response time, total request count, and error rates.

### Pros and Cons:
- **Current Approach**:
  - **Pros**: 
    - Detailed tracking of each request's response time and errors.
    - Flexibility in analyzing detailed metrics.
  - **Cons**:
    - Higher memory usage due to storage of individual response times and error messages.
    - Slightly more complex synchronization requirements.

- **Alternative Approach**:
  - **Pros**: 
    - Lower memory usage due to aggregated metrics.
    - Simpler synchronization with fewer data structures to lock.
  - **Cons**:
    - Loss of detailed individual response data.
    - Less flexibility in post-test analysis.

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements of the load testing scenario, such as the need for detailed response tracking versus overall resource efficiency.
